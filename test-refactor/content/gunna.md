Me and Andrey Shugalskiy (dragoy1) created a series of album covers and retouched a photo shoot for the American rapper GUNNA. This was supposed to be a continuation of the album DS4Ever. DS4Ever debuts at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The series of covers was made using materials provided by Daniel Arsham â€” American architect and artist who was the artist of the original album cover. Work on the album's sequel, and all it's accompanying visuals, was interrupted and never released. The reason for this was the initiation of legal proceedings against all YSL label artists and their detention.
